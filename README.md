# Super-Learner-Ensembles-Bagging-Ensemble-of-DL-Models-Stacking-Ensemble-for-DNN-classif-regression

Picking the top machine learning model is complex; try different algorithms and test efficacy with k-fold cross-validation. Train backup algorithm with multiple models to use as alternative. Utilize all models in group, not just the best. "Super learner" tests, educates and optimizes algorithms using various factors like covariates, loss functions, and tuning parameters. The model uses the super learner technique with 50 base-models and a linear meta-model for stacked generalization, resulting in a 1K x 50 input data. No overfitting. Super learner measures predictability and blends models with a meta-model. Test new data with regression and enhance predictions through training base-models on entire dataset for future use, if necessary for the super learner. Collect sample, merge results, apply meta-model. Steps: Acquire sample. Simplify models and merge predictions for meta-model predictions using a super learner algorithm.

Ensemble learning uses multiple models to improve predictions for better accuracy and stability. Train diverse models by using subsets of data with methods like cross-validation and bootstrap for estimating their performance on unseen data. Create resampling-based ensembles for deep learning neural networks. "Estimate performance and create ensemble with cross-validation." "Bootstrap to estimate performance, then bagging ensemble." Ensemble models improve forecasts with diverse and skilled members having low correlation in their predictions. Resampling with the same algorithm enhances predictions by estimating generalization error with subsamples without fitting to all training data. 3 resampling methods: Random splits & Cross-Validation. Dataset split into k folds, k models trained, Bootstrap Aggregation used with each fold as holdout set. Replace samples, unused become test set. Popular method: bagging. Resampling with replacement increases variance and differences in predictions. Only one train/test split needed if reliable performance estimate unnecessary. Ensemble models improve performance, but a single neural network suffices with limited resources. NNs are flexible, so resampling may not always improve performance, but is useful for model selection. Use resampling ensemble methods for the new model.

To optimize contributions, trust and performance on holdout set are key. Weighted ensemble outperforms model average. Use sub-model stacking in 2-level linear regression to enhance output predictions during training. Lvl 1: Meta-learner predicts. Stacked generalization reduces biases & stacked ensemble improves performance. Improve generalizer, use diverse dataset to train and split into train/validation. Train level 0 models and use for k-fold cross-validation when training level 1 model with predictions. Train meta-learner with diverse algorithms using untrained model predictions. Exclude same-type models in stacking. Blend predictions using regression, ensemble methods, and class probabilities. Also, create a deep learning model for improved accuracy.
